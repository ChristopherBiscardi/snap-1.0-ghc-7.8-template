Haskell Style Guide
===================

This document describes coding and comment style for the Snap projects.
Currently we're more interested in building a working web framework
than being code nazis and enforcing this style guide.  However, it
will be easier on everyone in the long run if contributors follow
these guidelines.  When something isn't covered by this guide you
should stay consistent with the style used in our existing code.

1. Formatting
-------------

### Line Length

Maximum line length is *80 characters*.

### Indentation

Tabs are illegal. Use spaces for indenting.  Indent your code blocks
with *4 spaces*.  Indent the `where` keyword two spaces to set it
apart from the rest of the code and indent the definitions in a
`where` clause 2 spaces. Some examples:

    sayHello :: IO ()
    sayHello = do
        name <- getLine
        putStrLn $ greeting name
      where
        greeting name = "Hello, " ++ name ++ "!"

    filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
    filter _ []     = []
    filter p (x:xs)
        | p x       = x : filter p xs
        | otherwise = filter p xs

### Blank Lines

One blank line between top-level definitions.  No blank lines between
type signatures and function definitions.  Add one blank line between
functions in a type class instance declaration if the functions bodies
are large.  Use your judgement.

### Whitespace

Surround binary operators with a single space on either side.  Use
your better judgment for the insertion of spaces around arithmetic
operators but always be consistent about whitespace on either side of
a binary operator.  Don't insert a space after a lambda.

### Data Declarations

Align the constructors in a data type definition.  Example:

    data Tree a = Branch a (Tree a) (Tree a)
                | Leaf

For long type names the following formatting is also acceptable:

    data HttpException
        = InvalidStatusCode Int
        | MissingContentHeader

Format records as follows:

    data Person = Person
        { firstName :: String  -- ^ First name
        , lastName  :: String  -- ^ Last name
        , age       :: Int     -- ^ Age
        } deriving (Eq, Show)

### Pragmas

Put pragmas immediately following the function they apply to.
Example:

    id :: a -> a
    id x = x
    {-# INLINE id #-}

In the case of data type definitions you must put the pragma before
the type it applies to.  Example:

    data Array e = Array
        {-# UNPACK #-} !Int
        !ByteArray

### Hanging Lambdas

You may or may not indent the code following a "hanging" lambda.  Use
your judgement. Some examples:

    bar :: IO ()
    bar = forM_ [1, 2, 3] $ \n -> do
              putStrLn "Here comes a number!"
              print n

    foo :: IO ()
    foo = alloca 10 $ \a ->
          alloca 20 $ \b ->
          cFunction a b

### Export Lists

Format export lists as follows:

    module Data.Set
        (
          -- * The @Set@ type
          Set
        , empty
        , singleton

          -- * Querying
        , member
        ) where

2. Imports
----------

Imports should be grouped in the following order:

1. standard library imports
2. related third party imports
3. local application/library specific imports

Put a blank line between each group of imports.  The imports in each
group should be sorted alphabetically, by module name.

Always use explicit import lists or `qualified` imports for standard
and third party libraries.  This makes the code more robust against
changes in these libraries.  Exception: The Prelude.

3. Comments
-----------

You should strive to write self-documenting code.  Comments should be
more about the *why* than the *what*.  They should make the reader
aware of higher-level concerns, ideas, constraints, pitfalls that are
not obvious from the code at hand.

### Line Length

Maximum line length is *70 characters*.  This increases readability as
the eye has to travel back to the start of the next line.

### Punctuation

Write proper sentences; start with a capital letter and use proper
punctuation.

### Voice

Comments should be written from the perspective of a narrator
addressing the user talking about the code.  The comment for a
function called *send* should be "Sends a message...", not
"Send a message...".  It is understood that the subject of the
sentence is "The send function", so those words should be omitted.

### Top-Level Definitions

Comment every top level function (particularly exported functions),
and provide a type signature; use Haddock syntax in the comments.
Comment every exported data type.  Some examples:

    -- | Sends a message on a socket.  The socket must be in a connected
    -- state.  Returns the number of bytes sent.  Applications are
    -- responsible for ensuring that all data has been sent.
    send :: Socket      -- ^ Connected socket
         -> ByteString  -- ^ Data to send
         -> IO Int      -- ^ Bytes sent

    -- | Bla bla bla.
    data Person = Person
        { age  :: Int     -- ^ Age
        , name :: String  -- ^ First name
        }

For functions the documentation should give enough information to
apply the function without looking at the function's definition.

### End-of-Line Comments

Separate end-of-line comments from the code using 2 spaces.  Align
comments for data type definitions.  Some examples:

    data Parser = Parser
        Int         -- Current position
        ByteString  -- Remaining input

    foo :: Int -> Int
    foo n = salt * 32 + 9
      where
        salt = 453645243  -- Magic hash salt.

4. Naming
---------

Use mixed-case when naming functions and camel-case when naming data
types.

For readability reasons, don't capitalize all letters when using an
abbreviation.  For example, write `HttpServer` instead of
`HTTPServer`.  Exception: Two letter abbreviations, e.g. `IO`.

5. Misc
-------

### Warnings ###

Code should be compilable with `-Wall -Werror`. There should be no
warnings.
